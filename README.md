# Integer-Programming-Blending-Problem
I solve a blending problem, which is commonly discussed in Ops Research literature, using google's 'ortools' package in Python

My goal with this problem is to solve a somewhat complex problem.  The problem requires multiple variables with subscripts as well as the use of tables to organize the assumptions.
